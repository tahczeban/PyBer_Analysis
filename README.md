# ***PyBer_Analysis_Challenge***
Module 5

***RESOURCES:***
Jupyter, Pandas, Python, matplotlib, SciPy, Numpy

***OVERVIEW:***
The purpose of this challenge was to inspect large CSV data files, merge data sets, perform calculations and create data series and DF's in order to help CEO V. Isualize determine ride sharing services access and affordability in three types of cities: urban, suburban and rural. The data sets considered were total # of rides, total # drivers, total fares for each city type, calculated average fare per ride and average fare per driver, in the months between January and April. The data was then be presented utilizing various chart and graph types for ease of comprehension and comparison.

***RESULTS:***
The differences in ride sharing data among city types could be seen by the following data:

                Pie Charts comparing % total drivers, % total rides and % total fares

                                          FIGURE 1
Figure 1 illustrates thqt urban cities have a significant greater percentage of drivers (80.9%) versus suburban (16.5%) and rural, with the least at 2.6%.

                                          FIGURE 2

The pie chart for percent total rides shows that again, urban cities accomodate greater percent total rides (68.4%) than suburban (26.3%) and rural (5.3%).

                                          FIGURE 3
Finally, urban cities demonstrate a greater percent of total fares (62.7%), versus suburban (30.5%) and rural (6.8%).                                        
               
As seen in the above figures, urban cities significantly had the most percent drivers, percent total rides and fares by city type, followed by suburban and rural.

                                          FIGURE 4
In contrast; however, urban drivers demonstrated the least averages for fares per ride and driver, with rural having the most and suburban in the middle (seen in figure 4).  Urban cities accomodates 1625 rides, in comparison with suburban at 625 and rural at 125. With more drivers, the dollar amount in fares increased significantly from urban($39,584.4) compared to rural ($4,327.9) and suburban in the moddle ($19,356.3). That being said, the average ride fares and driver fares were significantly less for urban, $24.5 and $16.6, respectively and more for rural $34.6 and $55.5, respectively.

                                          FIGURE 5
The graphical trends, in figure 5,  indicate increased usage between february and march across all city types, with urban and rural fares decreasing after april, while suburban fares increasing.
***SUMMARY:***

1. PyBer is utilized more and has more drivers in urban cities, making the most revenue
2. Drivers in rural cities make more money than other cities
3. The cost of using average fare per ride and driverPyBer services is greater in rural cities

RECOMMENDATIONS to the CEO, V.Isualize, and Omar are:

1.URBAN: Increase urban ride fares for increased profitability on a larger scale of use

2.SUBURBAN:Feature different automobile and ride share options to make it more appealing

3.RURAL: Increase number of drivers and ride share incentives for increased use

Lastly, consideration should be given for time of usage in terms of months across all city types. Perhaps increasing suburban drivers after april and decreasing urban and rural to accomote fluctuations in total fares could be taken into account. In addition to the timeline consideration, population and age demographics could be useful for future analysis.
